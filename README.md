# Experience-Project-Front-end-Developer-Freelance-Collaboration-with-WordPress-Developer-

This is a layout implementation based on a Figma design.  
I was responsible for creating the static responsive front-end part.  
The project is intended to be integrated into WordPress later (not by me).

## 💼 Project Type

Client work — HTML/CSS layout based on a design provided.  
Final goal: static layout → WordPress site (by another developer).

## 🛠 What I did

- Responsive HTML/CSS layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clean and scalable CSS
- Basic JavaScript interaction:
  - Modal popup
  - Quantity input with +/– buttons
